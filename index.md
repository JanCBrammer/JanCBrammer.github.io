I'm a [software gardener](https://blog.codinghorror.com/tending-your-software-garden/)
 developing open source [software for science](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01516-2),
wrestling the [complexity demon](https://grugbrain.dev) along the way.


## Experience

### Software developer / RWTH Aachen / 2021-present
I'm implementing open source research-data-management tools for inorganic chemists under the umbrella of the [NFDI4Chem](https://www.nfdi4chem.de) initiative, collaborating with a distributed team of developers and chemists.

#### Chemotion ELN
[repository](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN)  
Maintaining and extending an open source electronic lab notebook for chemists.
International, distributed team of developers and chemists.

#### TUCAN
[repository](https://github.com/TUCAN-nest/TUCAN)  
Developing and maintaining a domain-independent (i.e., organic and inorganic chemistry) descriptor and identifier for chemical molecules.

### Staff scientist / Radboud University Nijmegen / 2017-2021
Worked in research and development with tasks ranging from software development and data science to experiment design, and the publication of scientific articles.

#### biofeedback application development
[repository](https://github.com/JanCBrammer/OpenHRV) / [article](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.586553)  
Integrated heart and breathing sensor data into a virtual reality training to help Dutch police officers regulate acute stress.
International, interdisciplinary collaboration of police, game developers, designers, and scientists.

### Personal Projects / The Internet / ongoing

#### NeuroKit
[repository](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit) / [article](https://jancbrammer.github.io/neurokit_article.pdf)  
Implemented and maintain four core algorithms of one of the most popular open source software projects for physiological sensor data analysis.
Remote, international, interdisciplinary collaboration of developers and scientists.

#### biopeaks
[repository](https://github.com/JanCBrammer/biopeaks) / [article](https://jancbrammer.github.io/biopeaks_article.pdf)  
Developed and maintain an open source graphical user interface for the interactive analysis of physiological sensor data.
